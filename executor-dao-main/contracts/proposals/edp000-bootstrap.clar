;; Title: EDP000 Bootstrap
;; Author: Marvin Janssen
;; Synopsis:
;; Boot proposal that sets the governance token, DAO parameters, and extensions, and

;; extensions: "EDE000 Governance Token", "EDE001 Proposal Voting",
;; "EDE002 Proposal Submission", "EDE003 Emergency Proposals",
;; "EDE004 Emergency Execute".
